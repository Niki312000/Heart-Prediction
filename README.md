Heart disease is still one of the leading causes of death across the world, and catching it early can literally save lives. In this project, I tried to use machine learning tools to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease, based on data from things like medical history and wearable sensors.
I tested several different models—from classic ones like Random Forest to more recent deep learning approaches like TabTransformer. I also used SHAP and LIME to dig into what the models were actually doing, not just whether they worked. The idea was not just to make predictions, but to make sure we understood what the model was paying attention to.
Among all the models, TabTransformer came out on top in terms of accuracy and balance across precision and recall. But it also came with a cost—it was harder to interpret, which is not ideal in healthcare, where decisions need to be explainable.
The goal of this work wasn’t to build a perfect tool for doctors, but to show how predictive modeling and smart explainability methods can support real-world health decisions. Hopefully, this adds something useful to the ongoing conversation about how AI and healthcare can work together better.
